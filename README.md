# Running the ML Models
Dataset (For training LSTM_Appliances) - [Appliances Energy Prediction](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/374/appliances+energy+prediction) <br>
Run LSTM_Appliances.py, then run Tester_LA.py <br>
<br>
Dataset (For training LSTM) - [Individual Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) <br>
Run LSTM.py (WARNING - TAKES LONG TIME TO TRAIN), then run Tester_LH.py
